# Galápagos - Kurt Vonnegut - Reading Notes

These notes are on the novel *Galápagos* by Kurt Vonnegut, the novel which I have chosen as my independent study project reading.

## Book One - The Thing Was

### Chapter 1

This chapter discusses the mysterious history of the Galápagos Islands' native wildlife, particularly how it got to the state which it had by the time it was discovered by humans.

|Humans had much bigger brains back then than they do today...| 3    | This quotation seems to establish the idea that humanity has undergone a dramatic evolutionary shift in the million years since the present day.      |
|...I might entitle my story: "A Second Noah's Ark"           | 5    | This statement appears to be foreshadowing a cataclysmic event with allusion to the Noahic flood of legend, and the preservation of humanity via boat.|

## Chapter 2

This chapter introduces the reader to the character James Wait, a serial larcenist of wealthy older women and expert manipulator. From the brief introduction we receive in this chapter, it is made clear that Wait is an egoist and narcissist whose character embodies the "lizard brain", or basal survival instinct.
Wait's character also offers the first real example the narrator provides for the pure evils which the large brains of ancient humans were capable of. In fact, the chapter ends with a note on just that:

| This was a very innocent planet, save for those great big brains.| 9    | This quotation makes it abundantly clear that the narrator holds the belief that the large brain size of humanity was responsible for all of the evil present in the world a million years ago.|

## Chapter 3

This chapter offers a brief introduction to the *Hotel El Dorado*, the hotel which served as a place for passengers to meet before boarding the *Bahía de Darwin*, a cruise ship destined for the Galápagos Islands. The reader is also provided with
some bizarre backstory for James Wait, who turns out was an uneducated, inbred man whose childhood neglect resulted in an extensive criminal past.

## Chapter 4

This chapter covers the effect Charles Darwin's popularization of the Galápagos Islands had on Ecuadorian tourism, as well as the ease by which the big brains of ancient humans were swayed by mere opinions. This chapter also names the guests other than James Wait who will be voyaging on the Bahía.

| ...Ecuadorian paper money could be traded for food, shelter, and clothing in one moment and line the bottom of a birdcage in the next...| 17   | I suspect that this quotation is foreshadowing a financial crisis in Ecuador that will drive the plot forward in some way.                                                                     |

## Chapter 5

This chapter offers more in-depth specifications of the *Bahía de Darwin*, as well as elaborating on the severity of the financial crisis which swept Ecuador, along with all other nations a million years ago.

## Chapter 6

This chapter delves into the ever-increasing awareness of ancient humanity, and the disillusionment faced by many who believed the human brain to be the most amazing product of evolution to date. This chapter also deals with Mary Hepburn's struggle with suicidal thoughts. Meanwhile, James Wait schemes about Mary.

| "You are my enemy," she whispered. "Why would I want to carry such a terrible enemy inside of me?"                                      | 26   | Mary understands that the suicidal thoughts her brain is thinking are detrimental to her own well-being, and so she regards her brain as an enemy. This realization reveals Mary's true misfortune in the cognizance of her giant brain's hideousness.|

## Chapter 7

This chapter elaborates yet again on the severity of the financial crisis, and we are provided exposition as to how Mary Hepburn found herself on the *Bahía de Darwin* in the first place. This chapter also discusses the evolutionary advantage afforded to the flightless cormorant by its tiny wings.

## Chapter 8

This chapter explores the character of Roy Hepburn, Mary's deceased husband, and the nature of his death, an inoperable brain tumor. A brief anecdote about Galápagos penguins is provided as well.

| "All of a sudden I have this feeling that I never want to see another blue-footed booby as long as I live!" Little did she know.         | 37   | This quotation foreshadows stranding on the Galápagos Islands. This provides context for evolutionary selection pressures on good fishers, and thus flipper-like hands.                                                                               |
| Like those of the flightless cormorants, their ancestors, too, had abandoned the glamor of aviation——electing to catch more fish instead.| 39   | This serves to increase my suspicion that humans evolved to become better fishers, much like many native species.                                                                                                                                     |

## Chapter 9

This chapter explores the declining state of Roy Hepburn in the time leading up to his death, and the unreliability of his brain. He experiences false memories of participating in nuclear testing on animals.

| 'So long, old pal. You're going to a different world now. It's sure to be a better one, since no other world can be a bad as this one is.'| 42   | Roy's condition has clearly caused him to fall into a cynical state of mind, which is quite interesting if you consider that the original meaning of cynical comes from the Greek *kynikos*, meaning "dog-like". Roy can be later seen playing more with this very dog in the time leading up to his death.|

## Chapter 10

This chapter focuses on the dying moments of Roy Hepburn, in which he makes Mary swear to get remarried and to go on the *Bahía de Darwin's* cruise. The chapter ends back in Mary's hotel room, where she continues to contemplate committing suicide.

# Chapter 11

This chapter starts with a laissez-faire remark about Hepburn's suicidal thoughts, which is something I love about Vonnegut. This chapter takes the opportunity to expand a bit more on the passengers' characters. The nonchalant spoilers about upcoming character deaths make it clear that these events in 1984 are clearly not the main focus of the story. The main focus of the chapter is the events that led up to the Hiroguchis becoming passengers on the *Bahía de Darwin*.

| In the beginning, as in the end, I find myself speaking of human beings, regardless of brain size, as fisherfolk.                         | 54   | I almost wonder if this quotation is a subtle criticism of religion, an allusion to the "fishers of men" that Jesus supposedly made his disciples. Perhaps Vonnegut is noting that these self-identifying christlike fishers of men are also the manipulative fishers of people referred to in this chapter.|

# Chapter 12

This chapter begins with the Hiroguchis "sussuruing", which is an interesting word to use, about the perceived, and perhaps actual, maniacal mental state of Andrew MacIntosh. We learn that MacIntosh actually had no intention of boarding the cruise, and incidentally, he would not.

# Chapter 13

This chapter talks about the invention of Hiroguchi's computers, the Gokubi, and the later Mandarax, and creates an interesting comparison to his daughter Akiko, who, due to a mutation would be born with a seal-like pelt of fur. This chapter highlights the differences between the biological evolutionary process and the "evolution" of technology as creators improve it.
The key difference is Akiko's differences are the result of a random genetic mutation and happened to be beneficial for her survival, whereas the Gokubi's technology was intentionally modified by Hiroguchi in order to perform tasks extremely well compared to its predecessor, which is a common misconception that people have——that evolution progresses in leaps rather than gradually, but the truth is actually to the contrary.
